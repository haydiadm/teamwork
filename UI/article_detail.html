                    A repository is usually used to organize a single project.
                    Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets – anything your project needs.
                    We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project.
                    GitHub makes it easy to add one at the same time you create your new repository.
                    It also offers other common options such as a license file.
