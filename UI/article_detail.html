                <p>Toward the end of many follow-up discussions with most of the business owners pro-
filed in the book, I asked about their biggest
fears, worries, or concerns. All these people
had been successful, earning at least
$50,000 a year from their projects (many
were earning much more), but what werethey worried about? What kept them up at
night?
Their concerns fit into two broad areas:
external and internal. External concerns ten-
ded to relate to money and a changing mar-
ketplace. For example, a few businesses had
been created to exploit imbalances in tech-
nology. These projects can be very profitable
for a time, but when the music stops playing,
the ride is over. A business that grows
primarily from strong Google rankings or
good placement in the iTunes store (“favored
by the gods of Apple,” as one person put it) is
in danger of losing it all if fortunes change.
Scott McMurren, who published the Alaska
coupon books, said he was closely watching
the online coupon craze, considering ways to
update the business to be more digital-
friendly.
The role of competition was mentioned
frequently, although in very different ways.
Several people said they weren’t worriedabout what other businesses were doing, be-
cause they found it more productive to keep
moving forward with their own original
work. Others did worry, especially about
building something unique only to see it
copied or “stolen” by a more established
company.</p>
